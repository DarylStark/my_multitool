# The `too-few-public-methods` error is displayed when a classes have too
# little public methods.. We disabled this bacause this triggers errors on
# bases classes that are only there as way to define a standard initiator.
# We also skip the `too-many-arguments` since we need a lot of arguments for
# CLI endpoints.
